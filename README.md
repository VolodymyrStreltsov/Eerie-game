## Core Components
The game architecture revolves around multiple OOP classes including `Background`, `Player`, `Enemies` (Climbing, Flying, Ground), and `UIElements`, each contributing to the rich game dynamics. The `Game` class serves as the heart, orchestrating gameplay mechanics like enemy and reward generation, collision detection, and state updates.

## Gameplay Mechanics
Initiated on window load, the game springs into action, setting the canvas and booting the `Game` instance. Players navigate a challenging environment, steering clear of foes and collecting rewards, controlled by an `InputHandler` for seamless keyboard interactions.

## Features
- **Dynamic Enemy Generation**: Encounter varied enemies, each presenting unique challenges.
- **Reward Collection**: Boost your score by capturing elusive pumpkins.
- **Engaging Player Experience**: Manage lives, score, and energy with intuitive game design.
- **Visual and Sound Effects**: Immerse in the eerie ambiance enhanced with particle effects and collision feedback.

## Technical Highlights
- **Canvas Rendering**: Leverage the canvas for intricate 2D graphics.
- **OOP Design**: Organized and scalable code structure using ES6 classes.
- **Event-Driven Gameplay**: Fluid dynamics and real-time response to user input.

## Conclusion
`Eerie Game` exemplifies OOP's strength in game development, providing a structured, modular approach to building interactive 2D games. Check out the [source code](https://github.com/volodymyrstreltsov/Eerie-game) and explore the depths of canvas-based gaming.
